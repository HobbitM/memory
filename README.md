Hello, Im Mateusz Im just starting my coding journey. I had some minor expiriences with HTML, C++ and Pscal in highschool and was hooked from the get go but never followed throgh with it further and my career went completely different way. But i had some time recently to reflect and think about what I want to do in the future and I started learning by myself to maybe some day become a programmer. The question is why, well there are couple of things. Its very interesting and mind engaging. It aligns with my strengths I have very logical and orginized mind and logic is very important in problem solving. Last thing which i cant deny is financial standards in IT field which is a lot better than my prievious jobs. So in short those are factors that made me wanna try. I hope that answers the question. Regards, Mateusz.
